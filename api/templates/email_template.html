As part of our efforts to offer better insights, we have integrated a weighted analysis of our services. 
This weighting mechanism, based on the parameters provided in the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L9XDJa4yDsSSEy26RwbNQEOFvvf6t43VuC74VRZctkA/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Living Documents - Moladin Service List</a> helps us identify key cost drivers and understand their impact on the overall cost structure. 
This approach enables us to focus on areas that require attention and optimize costs effectively to every tech family on moladin.
