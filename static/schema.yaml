    Efficient cost and budget management are paramount for ensuring the uninterrupted functionality of our business, as well as our various teams and units. This document delves into our comprehensive strategy encompassing five key phases to effectively manage costs and budgets. The approach outlined here will enable us to proactively monitor and control expenses related to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and other resources. Furthermore, the document highlights the frequency of alerts, indicating that these vital notifications will be disseminated on both a weekly and monthly basis, enhancing our ability to maintain financial transparency and control.
